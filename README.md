## Google Home Integration for Home-Assistant

### Fork of the original component before the [deprecation](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/26035) with a workaround.

## Setup

1. Setup this repository as a custom repository in HACS.
2. Search under Integrations for "Googlehome" and hit install.
3. Restart HA
4. Go to Integrations and setup the Googlehome integration. You will need to sign in with a google account linked to your google home devices.
